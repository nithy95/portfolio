            I'm from a wonderous town called
            udumalpet[https://goo.gl/maps/6qqamPBuSsknEaTp7] in tirupur, India.
            From an young age I've had a curiocity of a cat, and many of my
            father's radios and DVD palyers has been sent to their grave because
            of itðŸ˜‚. I've got my first enounter with a computer in my 8th grade
            ever since then it's been a crazed ride.

          <p>
            After gradutating from high school, I picked computer sciecne as a
            Major from Kongu Engineering college because it felt like an obvious
            choice. From my second year of college I started developing android
            apps and websites with bunch of my geek friends,{" "}
